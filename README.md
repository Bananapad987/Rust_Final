# Rust_Final

Group Name : TBD

Group member names and NetIDs : Chi Jay Xu (cjxu2)

Project Introduction : We are planning on building a small platformer using Godot and rust.

Technical Overview : 

The first steps in the project is to have the ideas all layed out with what we want to do (ie: what a level will look like, sprites, what the player can do, what the enemies can do)

Once we finish that, the next step is to get used to Godot as well as rust for Godot (and just rust library stuff in general). We both are starting with no experience with Godot and chose it since we knew it can run with rust.

After that, we will focus on coding everything probably in this order:
Player
Level/Map
Enemies

Those are the main components and I think that once we finish those, the rest will be easy (or at least easier).

Possible Challenges : We have no idea how Godot works so that is going to be a bit difficult. However, with a few tutorials, I think we will make it through!
